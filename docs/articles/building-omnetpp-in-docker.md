title: Building an OMNeT++ Distro

Recently we started to use Docker to build OMNeT++ releases. This approach gave us reproducible results and
independence from the local development environment. While previously we needed a carefully configured Jenkins build
server, from now on anyone can re-create the release archives by simply checking out the OMNeT++ sources, going into the `releng` directory and executing the `build-omnetpp-in-docker` script (as long as `git` and `docker` are already
installed on the system). The docker images required by the build process are available on DockerHub.

Go and give it a try if you need to build an OMNeT++ distro for whatever reason.
